=head1 NAME

Net::BitTorrent::Design - Note to self: Stick to this or die!

=head1 Description

Blah. Blah. Blah. Initial design spec. Blah. Middle of the night. Yadda.

=head1 API Specification

My overall goal is to have something like this:

  use Net::BitTorrent;
  my $client = Net::BitTorrent->new( port => [6881..6890] );
  my %callbacks = (
    hash_pass => $client->on_hash_pass( sub { ... } ),
    hash_fail => $client->on_hash_fail( sub { ... } )
  );
  $client->add_torrent( path => 'a/legal.torrent' );
  $client->run(); # Simple wrapper around AnyEvent->condvar->recv;

...or this...

  use AnyEvent;
  use Net::BitTorrent;
  use Net::BitTorrent::Torrent;
  my $client = Net::BitTorrent->new( );
  my $torrent = Net::BitTorrent::Torrent->new( path => 'a/different.torrent' );
  # ...some sort of UI stuff here, file selection, etc.
  $client->add_torrent( $torrent );
  $torrent->complete->recv;

...or even this...

  use Net::BitTorrent::Torrent;
  my $t = Net::BitTorrent::Torrent->new( path => 'yet/another.torrent' );
  $t->scrape; # Scrape should work even in standalone mode. ...not announce.
  $t->hashcheck;
  printf <<'END', $t->name, $t->infohash, $t->percent_complete, $t->nodes;
  About %s / %s (%3.2f%% complete)
  [...file list or something...]
  The tracker says there are %d possible nodes in this swarm.
   ...
  END

...and yep, even mentally retarded stuff like...

  use Net::BitTorrentX::Storage::DBD::SQLite; # ...why? I blame lead paint.
  use Net::BitTorrent;
  my $client = Net::BitTorrent->new( );
  $client->add_torrent(                                             # Seriously.
      storage => Net::BitTorrentX::Storage::DBD::SQLite->new( ... ),# <- This is
      path    => 'this/is/sparta.torrent'                           # madness.
  );
  $client->run;

...and...

  use AnyEvent;
  use Net::BitTorrent::DHT;
  my $dht = Net::BitTorrent::DHT->new( nodeid => ... );
  $dht->get_peers( $_, \&dht_cb ) for qw[infohash_a infohash_b];
  AnyEvent->condvar->recv; # tick, tick, tick, ding!
  sub dht_cb {
    my ( $infohash, $peers ) = @_;
    printf 'We found %d peers for %s via DHT', scalar( @$peers ), $infohash;
  }

...all work. In other words, anything a nutter-- I mean user may come up with,
Net::BitTorrent should be thin and flexible enough to allow for it.

=head2 Net::BitTorrent

Basic, lightweight class which serves as the main client object and contains
the following attributes:

=over

=item torrents (ArrayRef[Net::BitTorrent::Torrent])

These are strong refs to Net::BitTorrent::Torrent objects.

=item tcp_ipv4 (Object|Glob)

The local TCP socket for IPv4.

=item tcp_ipv6 (Object|Glob)

The local TCP socket for IPv6.

=item udp_ipv4 (Object|Glob)

The local UDP endpoint for IPv4.

=item udp_ipv6 (Object|Glob)

The local UDP endpoint for IPv6.

=item timers (HashRef)

There will probably be a number of client-wide timers (AnyEvent timers,
actually). This is where I'll stick 'em.

=back

=head3 Net::BitTorrent->new( [...] )

Creates a new client object, opening random (matching) ports on both UDP and
TCP for both IPv4 and IPv6. The PeerID and DHT NodeID is generated internally.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent;
my $client = Net::BitTorrent->new( );

=pod

To modify this default behavior, the following arguments are recognized:

=over

=item C<disable_ipv6>

Disables incoming IPv6 connections for both UDP and TCP.

=item C<disable_ipv4>

Disables incoming IPv4 connections for both UDP and TCP.

=item C<disable_tcp>

Disables incoming TCP connections for both IPv4 and IPv6.

=item C<disable_udp>

Disables incoming UDP connections for both IPv4 and IPv6. Note that this
greatly restricts such things as DHT which require two way communication via
UDP.

=item C<port>

A single integer or a list of integers.

When handed a single port number, failure to open TCP/UDP sockets on this port
results in a non-fatal error.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent;
my $client = Net::BitTorrent->new( port => 1338 );
print $client->port; # Should print 1338 if the port was open sucessfully.

=pod

When handed a list of port numbers, each is attempted in order until we can
open all sockets (TCP and UDP on both IPv4 and IPv6 if enabled) on this single
port number. If we exhaust the list without opening a port, a non-fatal error
is thrown.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent;
my $client = Net::BitTorrent->new( port => [6834, 9517, 12589 ... 36587] );
print $client->port;

=pod

=back

If both C<disable_ipv4> and C<disable_ipv6> or both C<disable_tcp> and
C<disable_udp> are defined and true, a non-fatal error is thrown.

=head2 Net::BitTorrent::Torrent

Net::BitTorrent::Torrent is the base class for all .torrent-related objects.
If no arguments are passed to the constructor, metadata for a new .torrent
will be generated. Otherwise, this simple base contains the following data:

=over

=item C<path> or C<infohash>

The constructor requires either one of these:

=over

=item C<path>

This is the actual filename of the .torrent file you would like to load. This
file is slurped and the metadata it contains is parsed out on construction.

=item C<infohash>

As an alternative to the C<path> attribute, you may pass an infohash for a
swarm you would like to join. This will require support for BEP09 and BEP05
(or should I allow a tracker to be added?). After the metadata is retrieved
from the swarm, it will be stored as C<{save_path}/{infohash}.torrent>.

=back

=item C<storage>

This optional argument expects a C<Net::BitTorrent::Storage> object (or
subclass). This allows

=back

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Torrent->new( path => 'some.torrent' )

A .torrent can be loaded without a parent client object for information
gathering. Data will be expected to be in the current working directory when
the object was created.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent::Torrent;
my $torrent = Net::BitTorrent::Torrent->new( path => 'some.torrent' );

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Torrent->new( path => ..., base_dir => 'q:\storage' )

Loads a .torrent which looks for data to be in the C<q:\storage> directory.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent::Torrent;
my $torrent = Net::BitTorrent::Torrent->new(
    path     => 'some.torrent',
    base_dir => 'X:\BitTorrent\incoming'
);

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Torrent->status( )



=cut





=pod

=head2 Net::BitTorrent::Torrent::Factory

This class initially contains no files, trackers, or any other metadata.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent::Torrent;
my $torrent = Net::BitTorrent::Torrent->new( );

$torrent->files( 'FileB.ext', 'FileC.ext' );
$torrent->add_file( 'FileA.ext' );
$torrent->add_trackers( );
open my ($FH), '>', 'some.torrent';
syswrite($FH, $torrent->metadata); # Write the new .torrent to disk
close $FH;

=pod

This class will be coerce-able into a full fledged Net::BitTorrent::Torrent
object.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent;
use Net::BitTorrent::Torrent::Factory;

my $new_torrent = Net::BitTorrent::Torrent::Factory->new( );
# ... Add files, etc.
my $client = Net::BitTorrent->new( );
$client->add_torrent( $new_torrent ); # Metadata is loaded into new object

=pod

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Torrent::Factory->new( [...] )

This constructor accepts the following arguments (all of which are optional):

=over

=item C<name>

The name used by the torrent.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent::Torrent::Factory;
my $torrent = Net::BitTorrent::Torrent::Factory->new(

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Torrent::Factory->files( )

Returns the list of currently loaded files.

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Torrent::Factory->set_files( ... )

Expects a list of filenames which are added in the order they were passed.
This method clears the current list of files first. Duplicate files are only
added once (when first seen).

=pod

=head2 Net::BitTorrent::Storage

This object is passed or created by a Net::BitTorrent::Torrent object to
interface with the local filesystem.

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Storage->new( allocation_mode => ... )

Expected parameters for the constructor include:

=over

=item C<allocation_mode>

There are three modes in which storage (files on disk) are allocated in
Net::BitTorrent.

=over

=item * The traditional C<full> allocation mode. Net::BitTorrent uses
C<truncate> to allocate pieces which means that on NTFS with file compression
turned on, full allocation mode will only allocate storage for the downloaded
pieces. On other filesystems, entire files are filled up with zeros before
anything is downloaded.

=item * The C<compact> allocation mode, where only files are allocated for
actual pieces that have been downloaded.

=item * The C<sparse> allocation, sparse files are used, and pieces are
downloaded directly to where they belong.

=back

=back

=head2 Net::BitTorrent::Storage::Mode::Sparse [Role]

On filesystems which support sparse files, this allocation mode will only use
as much space as has been downloaded. It does not require an allocation pass
on startup.

=head2 Net::BitTorrent::Storage::Mode::Full [Role]

In full allocation mode, files are C<truncate>d to the correct size and null
filled. This is the simplest form of allocation and the default but comes with
the following drawbacks:

=over

=item * Allocating new files may take a while depending on their size since the
entire file will need to be null filled.

=item * Disk caches usually perform extreamly poorly with random access to large
files and may slow down a download session considerably.

=back

Benefits of this mode include:

=over

=item * Downloaded pieces are written directly to their final place in the files
and the total number of disk operations will be fewer and may also play nicer
to filesystems' file allocation. Fragmentation may also be less of a problem.

=item * No risk of a download failing because of a full disk during download.
...unless sparse or compressed files are being used.

=back

=head2 Net::BitTorrentX::Storage::Mode::Compact [Role]

Compact allocation only allocates as much storage as it needs to keep the
pieces downloaded so far. This means that pieces will be moved around to be
placed at their final position in the files after downloading is complete.

This role will probably not be included in the distribution.

=cut

=head2 Net::BitTorrent::DHT

TODO

=head2 Net::BitTorrent::DHT::Standalone [Role]

This role obviously extends Net::BitTorrent::DHT to function without a parent
Net::BitTorrent client.

=head2 Net::BitTorrent::DHT::Callbacks [Role]

This is an easy to apply role (...as if any were difficult) that adds an old
skool global callback system to the base DHT object. Currently supported
callbacks include...

=over

=item C<on_dht_packet_in>

=item C<on_dht_packet_in_okay>

=item C<on_dht_packet_in_error>

=item C<on_dht_packet_out>

=item C<on_dht_packet_out_okay>

=item C<on_dht_packet_out_error>

=item C<on_dht_ping_request_out>

=item C<on_dht_ping_reply_out>

=item C<on_dht_ping_request_in>

=item C<on_dht_ping_reply_in>

=back

This list will expand as the DHT system moves toward completion.

=head2 Net::BitTorrent::Network

This is the base class for Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP and
Net::BitTorrent::Network::TCP. See those modules for API information.

Internally, this class contains the following attributes:

=over

=item C<ipv4>

This is the AnyEvent io object related to this socket.

=item C<ipv6>

This is the AnyEvent io object related to this socket.

=item C<ipv4_sock>

This is a weak reference to the actual socket.

=item C<ipv6_sock>

This is a weak reference to the actual socket.

=item C<ipv4_host>

This is the hostname open for connections. The default value is C<0.0.0.0>.

=item C<ipv6_host>

This is the hostname open for connections. The default value is C<::>.

=item C<ipv4_port>

This is the port number open for connections. The default is C<0>.

=item C<ipv6_port>

This is the port number open for connections. The default is C<0>.

=item C<on_data_in>

This is a coderef which is called as a method whenever there is data to be
read or a connection to process.

=back

=head2 Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP [Ext]

This class holds both IPv4 and IPv6 UDP sockets.

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( )

Called without any arguments, this constructor open a random port on the IPv6
hostname C<::> and then attempts to open the same port for IPv4's C<0.0.0.0>.

This is the same as...

    Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new(
        port         => 0,
        ipv4_host    => '0.0.0.0',
        ipv6_host    => '::',
        disable_ipv4 => 0,
        disable_ipv6 => 0
    );

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP;
my $udp = Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( );

=pod

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( port => 3652 )

When handed a specific port number, the constructor attempts to open this port
on IPv6 and later IPv4.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP;
my $udp = Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( port => 3652 );

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( ipv4_port => 3652, ipv6_port => 3652 )

This allows you to open different ports for IPv4 and IPv6. I don't see how
this could be of any use but... there it is.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP;
my $udp = Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( ipv4_port => 3652, ipv6_port => 3652 );

=pod

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( port => [10000 .. 10050] ) [TODO]

When handed a specific list of port numbers, the constructor steps through the
list, attempting to open matching IPv6 and IPv4 ports until it succeeds.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP;
my $udp = Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( port => [10000 .. 10050] );

=pod

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( ipv6_host => '::1' )

The IPv6 socket will bind to this hostname. The default is C<::>.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP;
my $udp = Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( ipv6_host => '::1' );

=pod

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( ipv4_host => '127.0.0.1' )

The IPv4 socket will bind to this hostname. The default is C<0.0.0.0>.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP;
my $udp = Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( ipv4_host => '127.0.0.1' );

=pod

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( disable_ipv6 => 0 )

Disables the creation of an IPv6 socket.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP;
my $udp = Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( disable_ipv6 => 0 );

=pod

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( ipv4 => 0 )

Disables the creation of an IPv4 socket.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP;
my $udp = Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( disable_ipv4 => 0 );

=pod

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( disable_ipv6 => 0, disable_ipv4 => 0 )

This makes the constructor a no-op.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP;
my $udp = Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( disable_ipv6 => 1, disable_ipv4 => 1 );

=pod

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( on_data_in => sub { ... } )

This callback will be called as a method whenever there is newly C<recv>ed
data.

When triggered, the following parameters are passed:
C<$local_sock, $peer_paddr, $peer_ip, $peer_port, $data, $flags>.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP;
my $udp = Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP->new( on_data_in => sub { warn 'incoming!' } );

=pod

=head2 Net::BitTorrent::Network::TCP [Ext]

This class holds both IPv4 and IPv6 TCP sockets.

=pod

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::Network::TCP->new( on_data_in => sub { ... } )

This callback will be called as a method whenever there is a newly C<accept>ed
connection.

When triggered, the following parameters are passed:
C<$local_sock, $peer_paddr, $peer_ip, $peer_port, $peer_sock>.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent::Network::TCP;
my $udp = Net::BitTorrent::Network::TCP->new( on_data_in => sub { warn 'incoming!' } );

=pod

See Net::BitTorrent::Network::UDP for more information.

=head2 Net::BitTorrent::DHT

Net::BitTorrent's DHT functionality... blah blah...

=head3 Net::BitTorrent::DHT->new( client => $client )

This is how DHT is used internally. Our local nodeid is generated
automatically.

=cut

use Net::BitTorrent;
my $client = Net::BitTorrent->new( );
my $dht = $client->dht;

=head1 Callbacks

When triggered, callbacks receive a hashref containing at least the following
key/value pairs: X<alert_basic_attributes>

=over

=item B<message> => string

This is a (often simple) description (in English) of the event suitable for
display to the user.

=item B<event> => string

This is the kind of event which was triggered. This is useful if you use a
single callback coderef for many types of events (by category, etc.).

=item B<severity> => debug|info|warning|critical|fatal

This is an enum value which may be one of the following:

=over

=item debug

This will include a lot of debug events that can be used both for debugging
Net::BitTorrent itself but also when debugging other clients that are
connected to Net::BitTorrent. It will report strange behaviors among the
connected peers.

=item info

Events that can be considered normal, but still deserves an event. This could
be a piece hash that fails.

=item warning

Messages with the warning severity can be a tracker that times out or responds
with invalid data. It will be retried automatically, and the possible next
tracker in a multitracker sequence will be tried. It does not require any user
interaction.

=item critical

Signals errors which require user interaction or messages that almost never
should be ignored.

=item fatal

Fatal errors will have this severity level. Examples can be disk full or
something else that will make it impossible to continue normal execution. Do
not assume fatal errors lead to total client failure (exit/die/croak) because
that's annoying.

=back

=back

This is the current list of callback triggering events and the information
passed to them. Note that this list is subject to change. Unless mentioned
specifically, return values from callbacks do not affect behavior.

=over

=item C<listen_failed>

This alert is generated when none of the ports given in the prot range to
C<new>[<1|Net::BitTorrent/"new">, L<2|Net::BitTorrent::Standalone/"new">] can
be opened for listening. This is a C<fatal> error.

In addition to the <basic attributes|alert_basic_attributes>, this alert has
the following attributes:

=over

=item C<protocol>

This is either C<tcp4>, C<tcp6>, C<udp4>, or C<udp>.

=back

=item C<ip_filter>

This alert is generated when a connection is declined because the remote host
was L<banned|Net::BitTorrent::Network::IPFilter/"is_banned"> by our local
L<ipfilter|Net::BitTorrent::Network::IPFilter>. This is a C<debug>ging event.

In addition to the <basic attributes|alert_basic_attributes>, this alert has
the following attributes:

=over

=item C<protocol>

This is either C<tcp4>, C<tcp6>, C<udp4>, or C<udp>.

=item C<ip>

This is the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the banned peer.

=item C<range>

This is the L<Net::BitTorrent::Network::IPFilter::Range> object which caused
this peer to result in a banned state.

=back

=item C<file_error>

If the storage fails to read or write files that it needs access to, this
alert is generated and the torrent is paused. This is a C<fatal> error.

In addition to the <basic attributes|alert_basic_attributes>, this alert has
the following attributes:

=over

=item C<torrent>

This is the related L<Net::BitTorrent::Torrent> object.

=back

=item C<tracker_announce>

This alert is generated each time a tracker announce is sent (or attempted to
be sent). This is an C<info> alert.

In addition to the <basic attributes|alert_basic_attributes>, this alert has
the following attributes:

=over

=item C<torrent>

This is the related L<Net::BitTorrent::Torrent> object.

=back

=item C<tracker>

This alert is generated on tracker time outs, premature disconnects, invalid
response or a HTTP response other than C<200 OK>. From the alert you can get
the handle to the torrent the tracker belongs to. This alert is generated as
severity level C<warning>.

In addition to the <basic attributes|alert_basic_attributes>, this alert has
the following attributes:

=over

=item C<torrent>

This is the related L<Net::BitTorrent::Torrent> object.

=item C<times_in_row>

This is the number of times in a row this tracker has failed.

=item C<status_code>

This is the code returned from the HTTP server. C<401> means the tracker needs
authentication, C<404> means not found, etc. If the tracker timed out, the
code will be set to C<0>.

=back

=item C<tracker_reply>

This is an C<info>rmational alert generated when a tracker announce succeeds.

=item C<tracker_warning>

This alert is triggered if the tracker reply contains a warning field. Usually
this means that the tracker announce was successful but the tracker has a
message to the client. It is generated with severity level C<warning>.

In addition to the <basic attributes|alert_basic_attributes>, this alert has
the following attributes:

=over

=item C<torrent>

This is the related L<Net::BitTorrent::Torrent> object.

=back

=item C<url_seed>

This alert is generated when a HTTP seed name lookup fails. This alert is

A step above calculator humor.

=head2 Possible Client <-> Torrent <-> Tracker Relationship

I banged my head on something hard and this popped out:

If each url in a tier of trackers is linked to the parent client, I can avoid
creating duplicate objects for shared urls and enable multi-infohash scrapes.

Unassigned nodes are kept in a cache held by the routing table itself. These
are nodes with outstanding queries (usually pings). When they respond, we will
know their node id and can assign them to the correct bucket.

This is where I'll toss things which are currently disconnected but may be
important later.

=item C<hash_failed>

This alert is generated when a finished piece fails its hash check. You can
get the handle to the torrent which got the failed piece and the index of the
piece itself from this alert. This alert is generated as severity level
C<info>.

In addition to the <basic attributes|alert_basic_attributes>, this alert has
the following attributes:

=over

=item C<torrent>

This is the related L<Net::BitTorrent::Torrent> object.

=item C<index>

This is the zero based index for this piece.

=back

=item C<hash_passed>

This alert is generated when a finished piece passes its hash check. You can
get the handle to the torrent which got the valid piece and the index of the
piece itself from this alert. This alert is generated as severity level
C<info>.

In addition to the <basic attributes|alert_basic_attributes>, this alert has
the following attributes:

=over

=item C<torrent>

This is the related L<Net::BitTorrent::Torrent> object.

=item C<index>

This is the zero based index for this piece.

=back

=item C<peer_ban>

This alert is generated when a peer is banned because it has been involved
with too many corrupt pieces. It is generated at severity level C<info>.

In addition to the <basic attributes|alert_basic_attributes>, this alert has
the following attributes:

=over

=item C<torrent>

This is the L<Net::BitTorrent::Torrent> that this peer was a swarm member of.

=item C<ip>

This is the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the newly banned peer.

=back

=item C<peer_error_alert>

This alert is generated when a peer sends invalid data over the peer-to-peer
protocol. The peer will be disconnected but this alert also contains
identification information for future reference. This is a C<debug> level
alert.

In addition to the <basic attributes|alert_basic_attributes>, this alert has
the following attributes:

=over

=item C<peer_id>

If we have this peer's peer_id, you'll find it here. If not, this will be an
C<undef>ined value.

=item C<ip>

This is the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the newly disconnected peer.

=back

=item C<invalid_request>

This is a C<debug> alert that is generated by an incoming invalid piece
request.

In addition to the <basic attributes|alert_basic_attributes>, this alert has
the following attributes:

=over

=item C<torrent>

This is the L<Net::BitTorrent::Torrent> that this peer was a swarm member of.

=item C<ip>

This is the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the newly banned peer.
